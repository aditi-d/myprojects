problem:

log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.activemq.broker.jmx.ManagementContext).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.

Those warnings are because the activemq script does not seem to be
adding ../conf to the classpath so the log4j.properties is not being
used as part of the initialization.

Solution: Place log4j.properties in the src folder.

problem:
multiple producers and/or consumers are trying to connect to the mq. uses same port for rmi?

Solution: Change the way in which connections are created.
 //ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("vm://localhost");
 ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory();

Problem:
There are two entries for 61616 on wireshark's conversations for tcp. 61616 is the default port for activemq's tcp connections. 
How should packets for wireshark be counted?

Solution:
The way in which the producer initiates a connection with the consumer is as follows:
First the consumer is started. The consumer creates a connection with the activemq broker. 
Then the producer is started. The producer also initiates a connection with the activeme.
Then the producer send data. This data is sent over to the queue (activemq broker) by the producer. Then the queue sends over the data to the consumer. THE PRODUCER AND CONSUMER ARE BOTH RUNNING ON DIFFERENT PORTS. Hence two entries are seen.

Problem:
So how to find out the total packets send over the wire.

Solution:
Capture the data without sending any data at all. The only packets sent are of the connection between the producer and consumer with the activemq. Null might be sent but that does not form a separate packet of its own and is counted as negligible data. Since the consumer is started first, the relative time will show 61616 getting connected with consumer's port first.
